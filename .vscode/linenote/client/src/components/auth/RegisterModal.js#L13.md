Every value generated in a program is associated with a type. In a strongly typed language, the language implementation is required to check the types of operands in order to ensure that nonsensical operations, like dividing the integer 5 by the string ``hello'', are not performed.

Advantages: Provides earlier (and usually more accurate) information on programmer errors, providing documentation on the interfaces of components (e.g., procedures, functions, and packages or modules), eliminating the need for run-time type checks, which can slow program execution
